"""
Handles the main game loop and flow of the Wordle game.

This module contains the main entry point for the game, which includes:
- Initializing the player and NPC characters
- Displaying the initial game introduction
- Handling the player's actions in the basement and backyard
- Transitioning to the school sequence and completing the daily Wordle assignment

The game logic is divided into several functions that handle the different game sequences and player interactions.
